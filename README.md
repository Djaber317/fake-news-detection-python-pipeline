# fake-news-detection-python-pipeline
## About
In this python project we will use pipeline in order to create a model that can differentiate news from FAKE or REAL.

## The Dataset
The dataset we’ll use for this python project called news.csv. This dataset has a shape of 7796×4. The first column identifies the news, the second and third are the title and text, and the fourth column has labels denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE. The dataset takes up 29.2MB of space.
